This is the README file for ntimelord-1.0, for use with netatalk-1.3.
Please see the COPYRIGHT file.  This package's COPYRIGHT is *not* the
same as netatalk's.

Building ntimelord:

1.  Set DESTDIR in the Makefile.  DESTDIR should be the same as DESTDIR
    in your netatalk-1.3 source.  Setting it allows the ntimelord build
    to find the netatalk libraries and include files.

2.  When you've completed the configuration, type "make" at the root of
    the source.  This will make all binaries.

Installing ntimelord:

1.  To install the binaries, type "make install".  This will install
    all of the binaries in the directory specified by DESTDIR.

2.  The file rc.atalk as distributed with netatalk-1.3 includes lines to
    start ntimelord.

We have set up two mailing lists.  The first is for you to get help and
report bugs.  It is called netatalk@umich.edu.  If you're reporting
bugs, you MUST use the format provided in the BUGS file!  We will do
our best to help you.

The second (moderated) list carries announcements of new releases and
general discussion.  You can join (or resign from) this list by sending
mail to netatalk-admins-request@umich.edu.  Submissions (NOT requests
to join or resign) to this list should be sent to netatalk-admins@umich.edu.
