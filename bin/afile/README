This directory contains a couple of C utilities, afile and achfile,
and a script written in rc, acleandir, to help manipulate netatalk
files on Unix.

Briefly:

afile file ... 

displays Mac type/creator of a netatalk  file given either data or
AppleDouble file. Can be used to test whether file has a corresponding
data or AppleDouble file.

achfile file ...

changes type/creator of a netatalk file given a data file.

acleandir dir

cleans up a netatalk directory e.g. removes "orphan" AppleDouble files.

See the man pages for more details.

I've included a copy of line, used by acleandir,just in case it isn't
on your system.

acleandir is written is rc. I have used rc as my shell for
several years. Amongst its virtues is the way it handles the embedded
spaces you often get in netatalk files. See http://www.star.le.ac.uk/~tjg/rc/
for more info on rc.
