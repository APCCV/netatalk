Q1: Where can I get more information on Netatalk?

A:  The current location of the actively developed netatalk project can be
    found on SourceForge, at: http:/www.sourceforge.net/projects/netatalk.

    There are (at least) two very active e-mail lists to which you can
    subscribe, the first, netatalk-admins, is for usage and basic
    setup/compile questions. It is NOT maintained at sourceforge, but rather
    at the University of Michigan, which was involved with a good deal of the
    early development.  
    
    Subscribe by sending an e-mail to netatalk-admins-request@umich.edu with a
    subject of "subscribe" and a blank body. This can be very high volume, but
    usually a few messages a day.
    
    The archive is available at:  
    ftp://terminator.rs.itd.umich.edu/unix/netatalk/ and is called
    netatalk-admins.mail.  This is a ~6M mbox file. Previous archives are
    available there as well.
    
    Netatalk-devel list is more specific to coding and testing. It can be
    browsed at: http://www.geocrawler.com/redir-sf.php3?list=netatalk-devel,
    and subscribed to at:  
    http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/netatalk-devel This varies in
    volume, but is usually moderately active.
    
    netatalk-docs is specific to documentation. It can be browsed at:
    http://www.geocrawler.com/redir-sf.php3?list=netatalk-docs
    and subscribed to at:
    http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/netatalk-docs
    As far as I can tell, this list is completely dead.
    
    There are older netatlk information sites at:
    http://www.umich.edu/~rsug/netatalk/index.html
    http://www.anders.com/projects/netatalk/ and many unices have their own
    sites and distributions (tarballs, rpm's, packages, etc.)
    
Q2: What is this I keep seeing about asun?

A:  Before netatalk moved to SourceForge, Adrian Sun (asun) had written
    some patches to netatalk which helped significantly with it's usability,
    especially using appleshareIP. These patches are still provided by many
    unix vendors. I believe all of these patches are included in the current
    Sourceforge versions.


Q3: How do I get the most recent version of Netatalk?

A:  Via CVS from Sourceforge.net. This is the actively maintained version
    of netatalk, changes are being made constantly, and therefore it is not
    suitable for production environments. The netatalk at Sourceforge is in
    Beta, so keep that in mind.
    
    To create the CVS tree - from the directory you want to use as your CVS
    root, run:

    % cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.netatalk.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/netatalk login

    hit <enter> at the Password: prompt

    % cvs -z3
    -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.netatalk.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/netatalk co
    netatalk

    this will create a netatalk subdirectory, and check out all of the files.
    If you run this same command subsequently, you will update any files which
    have changed (on the CVS server) since your last checkout.
    
    Once you've done that, read the INSTALL file in the netatalk/ directory,

    plus the CONFIGURE file. You'll need to have some supplementary software
    installed, such as gmake. Additional information can be found in docs/.
    
    The main things to know, though, are this: you must run
    
    % ./autogen.sh in the netatalk/ directory first, in order to create your
    configure file. 
    
    Then run % ./configure --help | more in order to get a
    feel for which compile flags are available. Some of these flags are
    summarized below.
    
    To learn more about CVS, a good place to start is: http://www.cvshome.org,
    or http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual, or
    http://www.cvshome.org/form/form.cgi (this is the FAQ).


Q4: Can I get an almost current version of Netatalk without having to learn CVS?

A:  Yes.  Weekly (or thereabouts) snapshots of the CVS tree should be
    posted for the benefit of those that don't want to / can't use CVS. As of
    10/3/01, these were being put up at:
    
    ftp://ftp.marcuscom.com/pub/netatalk/nightly
    
    From the mail archives:
    I have started an archive of nightly CVS snap shots that build a tar.gz of
    netatalk ready to configure and build.  The images can be downloaded from:
    
    ftp://ftp.marcuscom.com/pub/netatalk/nightly
    This site only allows active FTP, so the snaps are also available at:
    http://www.marcuscom.com/netatalk/nightly
    
    You should be able to treat these images as you would a release.  Just
    configure as you normally work, then run make (or gmake as the case may
    be).  There is no need to run autogen.sh on these images.  Please let me
    know if you have any problems with these images.  Thanks. -Joe


Q5: I'm having massive file deletion problems!
Q6: I am having lots of file locking problems!
Q7: I'm getting this message in my logs:
    WARNING: DID conflict for ...  Are these the same file?

A:  Compile with the --with-did=last flag set. This activates a different
    method of calculating inodes in the software, and will hopefully fix some
    of these problems. This code, along with the CNID code, was still being
    worked out in Pre7. The cnid/db3 flags also go along with this:
      --enable-cnid-db   use persistent cnid database per volume (EXPERIMENTAL)
      --with-db3=PATH         specify path to Berkeley DB3 installation
      --with-did=[scheme]     set DID scheme (last,mtab) 
    
    (For more information on CNID, see the README.cnid file, into which I just
    copied wholesale Joe's comments on what he did with cnid and lastdid.)
    
    --with-did=last reverted things back to the old 1.4b2 directory ID
    calculation algorithm.  This also solved the problem of the syslog
    messages and the users complaining of file deletions.  It's also been
    found that by disabling *BSD's SOFTUPDATES feature on Netatalk volumes (on
    FreeBSD), multi-user interaction seemed to work better.  This was back in
    a late 4.2-BETA, so it's not clear if this still holds true in 4.4-RELEASE
    or not.


Q8: I can't seem to use passwords longer than 8 characters for my netatalk
    accounts. How can I fix that? 

Q9: I would like to use encrypted passwords to authenticate to the Netatalk
    server. How do I do that?

A:  Update to a newer version of AppleShare Client (I think the most
    recent is 3.8.8). This allows longer passwords, and will allow you to
    use encrypted passwords. Set which way you would like to authenticate
    in either afpd.conf or netatalk.conf, depending on your set up.


Q10: How can I set who has access to certain directories?
    
A:  You can certainly do this with your unix permissions, but also explore the 
    allow/deny/rwlist/rolist options in the AppleVolumes.default file:
    
    # allow/deny/rwlist/rolist format [syntax: allow:user1,@group]:
    # user1,@group,user2  -> allows/denies access from listed users/groups
    #                        rwlist/rolist control whether or not the
    #                        volume is ro for those users.
    
    Also, some unices, specically FreeBSD, have other options:
    (By Joe Clark)
    
    "What about file and directory permissions?  Since I didn't use the FORCE
    UID/GID code, I decided to use a feature of FreeBSD called SUIDDIR. From
    the LINT kernel config file:
    
    # If you are running a machine just as a fileserver for PC and MAC
    # users, using SAMBA or Netatalk, you may consider setting this option
    # and keeping all those users' directories on a filesystem that is
    # mounted with the suiddir option. This gives new files the same
    # ownership as the directory (similar to group). It's a security hole
    # if you let these users run programs, so confine it to file-servers
    # (but it'll save you lots of headaches in those cases). Root owned
    # directories are exempt and X bits are cleared. The suid bit must be
    # set on the directory as well; see chmod(1) PC owners can't see/set
    # ownerships so they keep getting their toes trodden on. This saves
    # you all the support calls as the filesystem it's used on will act as
    # they expect: "It's my dir so it must be my file".
    
     FORCE UID/GID code, I decided to use a feature of FreeBSD called
     SUIDDIR.  From the LINT kernel config file:
    
    # If you are running a machine just as a fileserver for PC and MAC
    # users, using SAMBA or Netatalk, you may consider setting this option
    # and keeping all those users' directories on a filesystem that is
    # mounted with the suiddir option. This gives new files the same

    # ownerships so they keep getting their toes trodden on. This saves
    # you all the support calls as the filesystem it's used on will act as
    # they expect: "It's my dir so it must be my file".
    
    And the associated mount command:
    
    mount -o suiddir /dev/da2s1e /macvol/artfiles
    
    This was used on my dedicated Netatalk/Samba filesystems.  On
    filesystems that were also used for interactive shell access, I chmod'd
    my Netatalk shares 2770.  The reason for this is that I set up a UNIX
    group for each department in the ad agency.  I had an art group, a media
    group, an accounting group, and then, or course, a general staff group.
    Each share was only allowed access by the group that needed to access
    the share.  So, the Artfiles share allowed access only to the art group:
    
    /macvol/artfiles "Art Files" allow:@art
    
    And the others followed in kind.  Therefore, the 2770 mask allowed only
    owners and people in the associated group access to read and write
    files.  The leading 2 set the setgid bit so that all child files and
    directories would retain the same group permissions.  I found this to
    work well.

Q11: What are the .AppleDouble and .Parent directories which are created in
     the netatalk locations?

A:  (also mention samba veto files, and the appledouble/MSwindows options
    in AppleVolumes.default
    
    The .AppleDouble folders hold the resource fork information for the mac
    files, plus other attributes which are not normally stored by Unix. For
    this reason, when you want to move files around in your mac volumes, it's
    a good idea to do it from the Mac side (as opposed to from the unix side,
    or Samba), unless you make absolutely sure you get the .AppleDouble
    directories. These directories are often hidden from the Samba side, via
    the veto files configuration.
    
    You can also set netatalk to not create an .AppleDouble directory unless
    it absolutely needs it, by setting the noadouble setting in
    AppleVolumes.default.
    
    
Q12: Hidden files - what's up with that?
    
A:  If you set the noadouble flag in AppleVolumes.default, you won't see
    the .Apple* or .Parent directories on the Mac side. If you use the veto
    files option in Samba, they may be hidden from the windows side as well.


Q13: I get a "socket: Invalid argument" error when trying to start netatalk
     under Linux. What is causing this?

A:  The "appletalk" and "ipddp" kernel modules have to be installed under
    linux for netatalk to function. The appletalk module can be automatically
    loaded by adding the line "alias net-pf-5 appletalk" to the
    /etc/modules.conf file. Issuing the command "modprobe (module)" will
    load the module for the current session.


Q14: netatalk works over Appletalk, but my IP connections are refused, even
     though I have enabled them in the configuration files.

A:  If tcp_wrappers support is compiled into netatalk, access has to be
    granted in /etc/hosts.allow for netatalk to successfully accept IP
    connections. This can be done by the addition of the line:
    afpd:  127. xxx.xxx.xxx. (whatever other subnets)    
    

Q15: I'm having Quark Express file locking problems, is there information on that?

A:  Yes, see below about the --enable-did= flag. Also, try using the
    --flock-locks flag. Enabling this code disabled the new byte locking
    feature.  With FLOCK locks, the whole file would be locked.  With byte
    locks, a byte range could be locked without locking the whole file.


Q16: I'm getting this error in Quark Express when trying to save a file to
     the server: 'Error Type -50'

A:  Turn off the document preview feature off in Quark.


Q17: Does netatalk work with Mac OSX?

A:  Yes, but only the most recent versions, and it's still being finalized.
    Versions prior to 1.5Pre7 did NOT work with OS X, although some really
    early versions did (netatalk 1.4+asun?).


Q18: I'm getting an 'Application for this document not found' error on OS X.

Q19: I'm getting an 'Error Type -43' error on OS X.

A:  Configure with --with-did=last. More info on this flag is below.


Q20: How do I get the directories that are created by Netatalk to have the
     correct permissions by default?

A:  Investigate the SetGid bit on your unix platform. It's a good idea to
    set this on your shared directories, and your .AppleDouble directories.
    From the mail archives: "Usually directories designated for use with
    AppleShare have the setgid (g+s) bit set.  It forces inheritance of
    permissions.  Without it, the .AppleDouble subdirectory can't be created
    since the new folder doesn't necessarily have the same write privileges."
    
    Also: Evi Nemeth's "Unix System Administration Handbook" which is chock
    full of useful advice (and one or two pieces of not-so good advice, but
    even those are debatable). Here's what it says about setguid (3rd. ed,
    chap 5.5, pg. 69):
    
    "The bits with octal values 4000 and 2000 are the setuid and setgid bits.
    These bits allow programs to acess files and processes that would
    otherwise be off-limits to the users that run them. ... When set on a
    directory, the setgid bit causes newly created files within the directory
    to take on the group membership of the directory rather than the defualt
    group of the user that created the file. This convention makes it easier
    to share a directory of files among several users, as long as they all
    belong to a common group. Check your system before relying on this
    feature, since not all version of UNIX provide it. ... This interpretation
    of the setgid bit is unrelated to it's meaning when set on an executable
    file, but there is never any ambiguity as to which meaning is
    appropriate." (any typos are mine)
    
    NOTE: The SETUID is usually discussed along with the SetGID bit. The
    SetUID bit is VERY dangerous. If you set it on an executable, and the
    executable is owned by root, anyone who runs that executable is root for
    the duration of that executable's run, so a clever person can leverage
    that into a full-scale compromise. The SETGID bit also has implications
    that way, so be careful where you set it.
    
    You set it by doing a chmod 2777 or 2775, or whatever. It's that first 2 bit.
    

Q21:  What does this error mean:
     'afpd[#####]: setdirmode: chmod .AppleDouble Operation not permitted'

A:  This can be due to a few things.

    1) The SetGid bit might not be set on either your directory, or on the
    .AppleDouble directory. I think the bit has to be set recursively on the
    .AppleDouble folder.
    
    2) You may not be member of the group set on the directory you're trying
    to write to.
    
    3) This was a persistant bug in 1.5pre6 for awhile, upgrading might help.
    
    
Q22: I'm having problems with the Trash folder: either when someone drags
     files into it, the system want's them todelete them immeidately, or files
     get stuck in there and won't delete.
    
A:  chmod the Network Trash folder to 2775 (/home/public/Network Trash
    Folder for instance).


Q23: The daemons aren't starting, things aren't showing up in the Chooser,
     and I get a message like this in the logs: afpd[####]: Can't register
     Tests:AFPServer@*

    This is sometimes a result of missing NIC information in the atalkd.conf
    file. Put your network interface (something like le0, eth0, fxp0, lo0)
    alone on a line in atalkd.conf, and reboot. When atalkd starts, it will
    populate the file with a line like: le1 -seed -phase 2 -addr 66.6 -net
    66-67 -zone "No Parking"

    To find your network interface, run

    % ifconfig -a | more
    and see which interface has your IP address. Use that one.

Q24: I want to be able to allow users to change their passwords?  How do
     I enable this feature.  Every time I try I get an error that it was
     unable to save the password.

A:  Use  -[no]setpassword in afpd.conf. This  enables? disables  the
    ability  of clients  to change their passwords
