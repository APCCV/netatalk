This is the Linux README file for netatalk.

We no longer include linux kernel code with netatalk, since Linux now
includes AppleTalk support.

1.  MAKE CONFIG.  Configure your kernel with "make config".  Answer yes
    to "AppleTalk DDP" support.

2.  INSTALL KERNEL.  Make and install your kernel.  Be sure to update
    your boot blocks!

3.  Linux 2.2.x provides the sendfile() call. This reduces overhead
    when sending/copying files. This option will be autoconfigured on
    compile. NOTE: you might run into problems if you have this option
    compiled in and you switch to a machine running an os < 2.2.x.


Netatalk supplies two different types of Appletalk servers and both
can run at the same time. Classic Appletalk requires afpd and
atalkd. Appletalk over IP only requires afpd.

Classic Appletalk on GNU/Linux requires that CONFIG_ATALK is compiled
into the kernel or as a kernel module. To check to see if the kernel
has Appletalk installed:

$> dmesg | grep Apple
This just parses the boot messages for any line containing
'Apple'.

To see all the  loaded modules (as root):
$> lsmod

If you don't find it, you may have to compile a kernel and turn on
Appletalk in Networking options -> Appletalk DDP. You have an option
to install as a module or directly into the kernel.

Some default distribution kernels have already compiled Appletalk DDP
as a module, you may have to edit your /etc/modules.conf to include:
"alias net-pf-5 appletalk ".

Note: check your distribution documentation about editing
/etc/modules.conf.
