Basic Installation
==================

Netatalk is known to run on at least five operating systems:

	OS	Versions	Hardware	Notes
	--	--------	--------	-----
	Solaris	2.5-8		Sparc
	Linux	1.3.x,2.x	PC
	FreeBSD	2.2-current	PC		after 12 Sept 96
	NetBSD	1.3		PC
	OpenBSD	2.2		PC
	SunOS	4.1+		Sparc		kernel must have VDDRV
						option installed
	Ultrix	4.[1-4]		3100,5000
	Tru64	4.0		Alpha		afpd only



For generic installation instructions see the file INSTALL in the main
source directory.

Netatalk supports some additional option to the ./configure script.
These are:

--disable-admin-group: disable admin group (default on),

--disable-ddp: disable DDP support,

--enable-dropkludge: enable the experimental dropbox fix (INSECURE!)

--with-shadow: enable shadow password support,

--with-pam: enable pluggable authentication modules support,
     PAM provides a flexible mechanism for authenticating
     users. PAM was invented by SUN Microsystems.
     Author: Andrew Morgan <morgan@linux.kernel.org>

     Linux-PAM is a suite of shared libraries that enable the local
     system administrator to choose how applications authenticate users.
     You can get the Linux PAM documentation and sources from
     http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/


--with-tcp-wrappers: enable TCP wrappers support.
     Wietse Venema's network logger, also known as TCPD or
     LOG_TCP. These programs log the client host name of incoming
     telnet, ftp, rsh, rlogin, finger etc. requests. Security
     options are: access control per host, domain and/or service;
     detection of host name spoofing or host address spoofing;
     booby traps to implement an early-warning system.  TCP
     Wrappers can be gotten at
     ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/

--with-ssl-dirs=[PATH]: specify path to OpenSSL installation. 
     NOTE: This is dependent on the same directory layout as the
     source distribution of Openssl. That is: ./include/ and
     ./lib/ to be on the same level. Many .rpm formats do not
     have their files laid out in this format.
     The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a
     robust, commercial-grade, full-featured, and Open Source
     toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
     and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols as well as a
     full-strength general purpose cryptography library.
     This is required to enable DHX login support.

--with-lastdid: Recreate version 37b behaviour where
     directory id's are incrementally calculated versus the new
     hash method. Unfortunately for machines that have a lot of
     devices, and/or a lot of inodes the hash can fail with
     multiple directories resolving to the same DID.
